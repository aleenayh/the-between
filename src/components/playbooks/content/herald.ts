You have always had a taste for blood… a taste He put in your mouth… a taste you indulged for the pleasure of it… but recently your indulgence has served an additional purpose: to get the attention of the people living in that grand house on Belgrave Square.

Add the trophies from The Informals playbook to the lines below. Hereafter, whenever Hargrave House chooses to kill or destroy a Threat or Mastermind, take a trophy from the kill and write it on a line below. The offering can be completed when all the trophies are collected; describe what the offering is, and what it looks like when you present it to your slumbering god, and then retire this character. <strong>The offering is one of the keys needed to unlock the Arcane Prison.</strong> ",
