		"The Great Forest, called Calduun in the language of the Fae, and the Emerald Expanse by its current Lord, is one of the Lands Remaining. It is a vast temperate forest, the size of a large kingdom, with many deep, unexplored parts. Small fiefdoms were located on its outer edge during the time of the Old Fire, and remnants of those places can still be found there. The true beating heart of the Great Forest, however, were the large Fae settlements, most now fallen to ruin and rot, and one, the great Fae city of Liralen, having disappeared entirely. The Great Forest is now a place of fell beasts, and ruled by an ancient dragon, Noxilliax, the Emerald Nightmare, a glimmering winged horror that is rarely seen in the flesh, but felt in every tree and trail, and represented on the ground by its numerous human followers.",

			description: [
				"The Emerald Knights are the oldest and most faithful servants of Noxilliax, sworn to the dragon long before the Dimning, and remaining loyal long after it ceased to speak to them. They act as wardens, ritual attendants, and executioners throughout the Great Forest, enforcing Noxilliax’s will not through decree but through presence. Their armor is pale green scale mail, lacquered to a wet-leaf sheen and edged with bronze that has darkened to near black. Their helms are crested and angular, shaped to suggest draconic brows and horns. Most wield long spears or glaives with leaf-shaped blades, though some carry heavy swords whose edges are wreathed in green flame. <strong>Some names, if you need them:</strong> Sir Caelthorn, Lady Verdanth, Sir Oryx Vale, Lady Melys Greenward, Sir Halvren Mosscloak, Lady Isereth Boughborne.",

Green Embers are always found alone (each believes they are the true Green Ember), and usually at sites of Green Grace. They consider the Embers to be competitors, and are usually hostile.

				"This layer is unlocked at the end of the first session of play after the Embers arrive at the Great Forest. Immediately read the following:",

				"Before we go to the End of Session, I want to tell you that elsewhere in the Great Forest, far from your path, a procession moves beneath the canopy. A dozen knights advance in silence, their armor a pale, milky green—scale mail that catches the light like wet leaves. They carry a litter between them, borne on ashwood poles wrapped in ivy. Upon it lies a small beast’s body. It is unmistakably draconic, and unmistakably wrong. Its wings are half-formed, the membranes thin and torn like unfinished parchment. One horn never fully grew. Its scales are soft in places, translucent in others, as if they never learned how to harden. A faint green sheen still clings to it, like light dying behind fogged glass. This is no slain wyrmling. This is a stillbirth.",

				"The knights reach a shallow cave in a rocky rise, its mouth carved with ancient sigils of the Fae and newer marks scratched crudely over them—spirals, talons, crude draconic eyes. They set the litter down and kneel. With ritual care, they draw curved knives and begin to work. The act is reverent, almost tender. Scales are peeled away intact, cleaned, and wrapped in linen. None are wasted. None are taken without a murmured prayer. When the skinning is done, the knights place the scales into lacquered chests marked with the sigil of the Emerald Nightmare.",

				"They carry the body into the cave and lay it in a stone cradle hollowed generations ago. One knight pours a vial of green ichor over the corpse. Another lights a censer of crushed leaves and resin. They seal the cave with a slab of stone etched with a single phrase in draconic script: “Return to the Root.” As the last knight rises, a tremor passes through the forest. Leaves shiver. Birds scatter. Somewhere beyond knowing and sight, something vast and ancient shifts in its sleep. Noxilliax has felt the loss.",

				"To reach the Throne of the Old King, the Embers will need the key to the Old Capital held by Noxilliax, the Emerald Nightmare, Lord of the Great Forest. The Embers don’t yet know it but we do: Noxilliax has used powerful magic to hide the great Fae city of Liralen, now its lair, and the Embers will have to locate Liralen in order to confront the great dragon. As players, we have our own Question to answer: <strong>How can the spell that hides Liralen be lifted?</strong> (Complexity: 8) The Embers will immediately confront Noxilliax once we’ve answered it.",

				"<li>In the time of the Old Fire: Noxilliax’s clutches never thrived; its young hatched malformed, weak, and small, dying within days despite the forest’s abundance. The Great Forest learned to mourn beneath emerald wings, and the dragon’s lair became a place of quiet, repeating loss rather than ancient splendor.</li>",
				"<li>Just before the Dimning: Grief hollowed Noxilliax, and the Dimning found a wound to enter; dreams soured, and the dragon’s communion with growth and renewal twisted into fixation and dread. Where once it nurtured life, it began to hoard it, fearing every ending was another theft.</li>",
				"<li>During the Dimning: Noxilliax turned upon the fair folk of Liralen, waging a war of emerald fire and collapsed glamour. Liralen burned, the Fae were driven out, and the dragon crowned itself the sole sovereign of Calduun.</li>",
				"<li>Three centuries ago: For many years, Noxilliax continued to bear no fruitful clutches, and in its terrible grief slowly turned its face from the Emerald Knights who had served it faithfully since the time of the Old Fire. The dragon ceased granting visions, blessings, or command, yet the knights remained, interpreting silence as sacred withdrawal, and grief as a holy charge.</li>",
				"<li>One century ago: When the time of the Embers came to the Great Forest, whispers spread among pilgrims, cultists, and knights alike that Noxilliax was more than a dragon. Some claimed it was a reincarnation of the Old Fire itself, reborn in green flame, while others feared it was no more than the Old Fire’s pale green shadow.</li>",
				"<li>Mere decades ago: Before Ambarell fell completely silent, representatives of the Old King entrusted Noxilliax with a key to the Capital, believing no force could wrest it from an ancient dragon. Noxilliax used powerful magic to hide its lair at Liralen entirely, sealing the city away to protect the key—or to ensure that no one could reach the Throne of the Old King without first submitting to the Emerald Nightmare’s dominion.</li>",
